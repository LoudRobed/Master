TODO:

Get some results.

How? It's easy! You schedule a job in kongull, wait for it to finish, then move the results into a folder of its own. Then you write a program to make some grapsh.

Create the results first, and document the results. Try just one parameter at a time, no need to go all crazy, just get it done.
